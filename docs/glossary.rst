Delta
   A framework for protecting content so that it can be shared securely across
   networks and organisations. Delta achieves this by allowing an identity to
   create and distribute secrets to other identities.

Identity
   An entity (such as user, device, or another service) registered with Delta,
   that is uniquely identifiable, and has possession of an encryption key pair
   and a signing key pair.

IdentityId
   An identifier generated by Delta that is unique and associated with
   retrieval and designation of an identity.

Identity metadata
   Optional, textual, owner-provided key-value pairs used for lookup,
   associated with an identity.

Encryption key pair
   An asymmetric key pair (consisting of the public encryption key and the
   private decryption key), associated with an identity for the purpose of
   encryption and decryption of secret encryption keys.

Public encryption key
   The public key of an asymmetric key pair (the private counterpart being the
   private decryption key), functioning as a key encryption key (KEK), to
   encrypt a secret encryption key. The public encryption key is associated
   with an identity and published on Delta.

Private decryption key
   The private key of an asymmetric key pair (the public counterpart being the
   public encryption key), used to decrypt a secret encryption key. The
   private decryption key must be managed outside of Delta.

Signing key pair
   An asymmetric key pair (consisting of the private signing key and the public
   signing verification key), associated with an identity for the purpose of
   request signing and authentication.

Public signing verification key
   The public key of an asymmetric key pair (the private counterpart being the
   private signing key), used to verify request authenticity and ownership.
   The public signing key is associated with an identity. However, unlike
   public encryption keys, public signing verification keys are not published
   by Delta.

Private signing key
   The private key of an asymmetric key pair (the public counterpart being the
   public signing verification key), used to sign requests as required by
   Delta so that the service can verify request authenticity and ownership.
   The private signing key must be managed outside of Delta.

Secret
   An entry in Delta, comprising of protected secret content, encryption
   details, core attributes, and secret metadata.

SecretId
   An identifier generated by Delta that is unique and associated with
   retrieval and designation of an Secret.

Secret content
   Plaintext data that an identity wants to protect (such as a password,
   symmetric key or small text file). Secret content is limited to 200KB in
   size.

Protected secret content
   Encrypted secret content, protected by a secret encryption key.

Secret metadata
   Optional, textual, owner-provided key-value pairs used for lookup,
   associated with a secret.

Encryption details
   Client-generated attributes associated with the encryption of the secret
   content. The encryption details contain the protected secret encryption
   key, initialization vector (IV), and any other keying material required
   for the decryption of the protected secret content.

Core attributes
   Service-generated attributes associated with a secret (SecretId, Owning
   IdentityId, CreatedDate, ModifiedDate).

Secret encryption key
   A symmetric key used to encrypt or decrypt the secret content. The secret
   encryption key in turn is protected by a public encryption key of an
   Identity.

Protected secret encryption key
   The secret encryption key, encrypted with the public encryption key of an
   identity and stored as part of a secret.

Base secret
   A secret whose secret content is encrypted using the public encryption key
   of the owning identity.

Owning identity
   An identity in Delta responsible for creation of a base secret.

Receiving identity
   An identity in Delta that is the recipient of a derived secret.

Derived secret
   A secret that should contain the same secret content as a base secret, where
   this secret content is protected/encrypted by a secret encryption key,
   which in turn is encrypted using the public encryption key of the receiving
   identity. Derived secrets are the mechanism through which secret content is
   shared between identities. A derived secret can only be created by the
   owning identity of the base secret.

Events
   Operations performed on identity and secret entries in Delta that can be
   retrieved in a structured manner.
